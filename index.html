  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>Hello World! My name is Dominique but most just call
    me "Michie"; I am a senior and I am graduating this semester with a
    degree in IT and Informatics. I plan on coming back and finishing
    a degree in Software App Development/Human Communication Interaction.
    Through my academic career, I have been introduced to MySQL, Python, Java, and
    HTML/CSS. I have learn how to navigate Adobe PhotoShop, XD and Dreamweaver.

    <h2>The Websites that I like</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/" target="_blank">Webtoons</a>- Even though it is busy, it makes sense. Its structure is sound and has this vibrant, cartoon theme. I like the moving transitions of the weekly highlights. </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>- The home page is long but organized and tailored to my familys' wants base on past history. Different themes are divided neatly. </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.indeed.com/" target="_blank">Indeed</a>- It is very simplistic and sets the mood for a user to get straight to business. I like the view of job options on one column and the chosen job position on the other. </li>
      </ul>

    <h2>The Websites that I do not like</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://m.manganelo.com/homepage" target="_blank">Manganelo</a>- This homepage is not welcoming and it is overwhelming. It is not until you scroll to the end of the page until you can pick specific genres. </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">Youtube</a>- It is a cosmic trap that pulls you into the world of videos longer than you want to. The home page is <em>compacted</em> with videos of recommendations, suggestions and subscriptions with minimum division.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>- The layout smashes three columns into a single page of chaos. Two station columns with a moving timeline in between them seems too much for the main navigation page. </li>
      </ul>
