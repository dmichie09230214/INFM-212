      <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>This all started as a "New girl around the block" and a boy who decided to give me a tour of
          the neighborhood. We went to high school together and yes, we have been together ever since.</p>

      <h2>Moving Out</h2>
        <p>Five years later, we move into our own place and it was great timing because months later, I
          found out that I was expecting my son.</p>

      <h2>Georgia bound</h2>
        <p>Five years later, and after getting married on our ten year anniversary, his job relocated to
          Georgia and we followed them here. A few months of settling here, we found out that we were
          expecting my daughter</p>

      <h2>The Present</h2>
        <p>Six years later, we all have grown into quite a funny, sarcastic and happy family (I'm serious;
          even the six year old is funny and sarcastic).</p>
